Evolution of art works by adding, changing, coloring ...

see http://picturEvolution.org

You know the coloring books for adults where you can spend hours or even days creating beautiful unique copies?
While one purpose is to relax while coloring them it would be nice to share your version with the world.

This is possible with picturEvolution:
  * everyone can share her art works with the world
  * you can rate the artworks with up to five stars
  * you can sell your own art works for one Euro as PDF Download
  * you can auction the original for a price you can define
  * modified copies can be uploaded and connected to the original

The revenues will be divided: 
  * 1/3 of the revenues are donated to http://plant-for-the-planet.org to do something against the climate change 
  * 1/3 is used for further development and hosting costs
  * 1/3 goes back to the creator of the artwork
